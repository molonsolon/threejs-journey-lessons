# Common Textures

## Color (or Albedo)
* most simple
* applied to geometry

## Alpha
* grayscale image
* white visible
* black no visible

## Height (or Displacement)
* greyscale 
* move the vertices to create some relief
* need enough subdivision

## Normal
* adds detaiil
* doesn't need subdivision
* vertices won't move
* lure the light about the face orientation
* better performance than adding a height texture with a lot of subdivision

## Ambient Occlusion
* grayscale image
* add fake shadows in crevices
* not physically accurate
* helps to create contrast and see details

## Metalness
* grayscale image
* white is metallic
* black is non-metallic
* mostly for reflection

## Roughness
* grayscale image
* often in combo with metalness
* white is rough
* black is smooth
* mostly for light dissipation

## PBR
These textures (esp metalness and roughness) follow PBR principles

* Physically based rendering
* many techniques that tend to follow real-life directions to get realistic results
* becoming standard for realistic renders
* many software, engines, and libraries are using it

# How to load textures

## Getting URL of the image
To load texture, we need URL of the image file. With webpack, there are two ways of doing this

1. Put the image texture in the `/src/` folder and import

2. Put the image in the `/static/` folder and access it directly. This is the technique we will use

## Loading the image
There are multiple ways to load an image

### Using native JavaScript
Create an `Image` instance, listen to the `load` event, and change its `src`.

Create a `texture` variable with the Texture class
We need to use that `texture` in the `material`.
Unfortunately, the `texture` variable cannot be accessed directly because it's inside our `onload(...)` function.

### Using TextureLoader
Instantiate a variable using the `TextureLoader` class and use its `.load(...)` method to create a new texture

One instance of `TextureLoader` can load as many textures as needed.

Can send 3 functions after the path URL:
* `load` - when the image loaded successfully
* `progress` - shows progress
* `error` - displays error if image cannot be loaded 

### Using LoadingManager
The purpose is to mutualize the events. It's useful if we want to know the global loading progress or be informed when everything is loaded.

## UV Unwrapping
Texture is being stretched or squeezed in different ways to cover the geometry
this is UV unwrapping, each vertex will have 2D coordinates on a flat plane. Sort of like origami!

We can see these UV coordinates in `geometry.attributes.uv`. These are generated by Three.js. If you create your own you'll have to specify UV coordinates. If you're using 3D software, you'll also have to specify UV unwrapping.
